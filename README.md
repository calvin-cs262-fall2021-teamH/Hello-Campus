# Project



## Vision Statement
We aim to provide a platform that grants new students and visitors an intuitive and meaningful introduction to Calvin’s campus. Through this application, users will gain a deeper understanding of Calvin University’s campus, including historical facts, current activities, and services provided by the university. Based on GPS navigation, our application will provide information pertaining to the user’s location and nearby points of interest.

Comparative Analysis of Competing Systems

Calvin University currently has a virtual campus tour on their website, however this tour only provides the basic purposes of the buildings, excluding most or all of the information about building architecture, history, and generally interesting information which we plan to provide. Our goal is to allow users to experience the campus in a more fulfilling way.
